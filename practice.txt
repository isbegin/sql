use sql_store;
select *,quantity * unit_price as total_price
from order_items 
where order_id = 2 
order by quantity * unit_price 

Limits
select * from customers

limit [offset],[number of records]
--ex: limit 5,2 this will skip 5 records 
and display next 2 records 

Excersise -- Get the top 3 loyal customers
select * 
from customers
order by points desc
limit 3

Inner Join
select order_id, first_name, last_name

from orders
join customers

on orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
-- this will join order and customers table using 
-- customer_id, Note: Join means inner join

--using alias name in table
select order_id, o.customer_id,c.customer_id

from orders o

join customers c

on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
-- for joining table from different database 
-- use databasename.tablename 

-self join
use sql_hr;

select e.employee_id,e.first_name,m.first_name as manager

from employees e
 
join employees m

 on e.reports_to = m.employee_id


Joining Multiple Tables
use sql_store;

select o.order_id,c.first_name,os.name

from orders o

join customers c

 on o.customer_id = c.customer_id

 join order_statuses os
  on
 o.status = os.order_status_id

compound join
using multiple condition to joining tables
select *
from order_item oi
join order_iten_notes oin
 on oi.order_id = oin.order_id
 and oi.product_id = oin.product.id

Implicit join
select *
from orders o, customers c
where o.customer_id = c.customer_id


Outer Join : Displays all the records of
left or right table
select c.customer_id, c.first_name
from orders o 
left join customers c
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id

Outer Join Example between two tables
select p.product_id, p.name,oi.quantity

from products p

left join order_items oi

on p.product_id = oi.product_id

order by p.product_id

outer join between multiple tables
select

c.customer_id,

c.first_name,

o.order_id,

sh.name as shipper

from customers c

left join orders o

on c.customer_id = o.customer_id

left join shippers sh

on o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id

order by c.customer_id
